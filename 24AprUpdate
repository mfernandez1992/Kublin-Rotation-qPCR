#Today, incorporated my Mic and QuantStudio qPCR data into my Jupyter notebook. 
#combined the two into one data set and plotted individual graphs.
#Jacob did a LOT of work to manipulate the data, including running statistical analysis and determining 
#the equation of the trendlines, which I needed for efficiency calculations.
#At the end of my day, I finally figured out how to calculate efficiencies from the slopes of the equations and add the values to 
#the dataframe within Jupyter/R. 


#To Do:
# Find out how to push the file 'efficiency.ipynb' to my github account..
# Continue working through Jacob's work to understand what was done at each step.
# print graphs WITH efficiencies printed on backgrounds (geom_text()??)
