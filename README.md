# Kublin-Rotation-qPCR

# Information and data pertaining to my qPCR experiments with the Kublin lab
# 'Protocol' file will contain all primers, amplification conditions and qPCR chemistry information. 
# 'Data' file will contain all raw data outputs from Quantstudio machine (Thermo). 
# 'Scripts' file will contain R codes used in various analyses.

# There are/will be two qPCR experiments documented here: 
# 1) quantitation of bacteral gDNA to monitor species-specific growth in our eventual germ-free mouse inoculum communities. 
# 2) ddCt analysis of spelnocyte genes to measure effects of inocula supernatants from 1) on expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes.
